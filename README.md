3. **Problem Statement**  
Booking available sports slots can become frustrating due to double bookings, lack of real-time availability, and no simple way to find nearby sports venues. Additionally, many players miss out on sports competitions because they are not aware of events happening either locally or across India. This project aims to simplify the booking process while also helping players discover and participate in competitions easily.

4. **Proposed Solution / Idea**  
"A platform that allows players to check and book available sports slots in real-time [one/many]. The app requests location permission to display sports venues **near the user** for convenient booking. It also displays details of ongoing and upcoming **sports competitions across India**, enabling users to discover and register effortlessly."

5. **Key Features**
- Real-time sports slot availability check and booking  
- **Location-based suggestions for nearby sports venues**  
- Competition listings with location, dates, and registration options across India  
- Player profiles for tracking booking and competition history  
- Admin panel for facility owners to manage slots and events  

6. **Target Users / Audience**  
"Sports players, sports clubs, and event organizers."

7. **Technology Stack**  
Frontend: JavaScript, React Native  
Backend: Express  
Database: MySQL  
ORM: Prisma

8. **Expected Outcome**  
A functional sports booking app that allows users to book slots seamlessly, discover nearby sports venues, explore competitions across India, and register — all in one platform — improving accessibility, convenience, and participation in sports activities.
