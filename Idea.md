3. Problem Statement-
Booking available sports slots can become frustrating due to double bookings, and lack of real-time updates. Additionally, many players miss out on local sports competitions simply because they are not aware of them. This project is aiming to make slot booking for sports easy, while also helping players discover and participate in nearby competitions.

4. Proposed Solution / Idea-
"A platform that allows players to easily check and book available sports slots in real-time. If a slot is already booked, the system will automatically suggest the next available time. The platform will also display details of ongoing and upcoming sports competitions in the user’s locality, enabling easy registration and participation."

5. Key Features-
Real-time sports slot availability check and booking.
Automatic next-slot suggestion if the desired slot is unavailable.
Competition listings with location, dates, and registration options.
Player profiles for tracking bookings and competition history.
Admin panel for facility owners to manage slots and events.
Secure authentication and payment integration.

6. Target Users / Audience
"Sports players, sports clubs, and event organizers."

7. Technology Stack

Frontend: HTML, CSS, JavaScript, React.js

Backend: To be updated

Database: To be updated

Additional Tools: Payment Gateway API

8. Expected Outcome
A functional sports booking website that allows users to book slots seamlessly, discover local competitions, and register for them—all in one platform—improving convenience and participation in sports activities.

9. Additional Notes (Optional)
"The main challenge for this project is making a proper backend along with payment gateway."
